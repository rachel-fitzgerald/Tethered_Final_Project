Tethered: Design Notes

1. Design Inspiration & Goals  
The design of Tethered focuses on simplicity, warmth, and emotional support. Inspired by apps like Paired and Finch, the goal is to create a digital space that helps couples stay connected through daily, low-effort check-ins that spark deeper conversation and emotional awareness.

2. Core Features Chosen  
- Daily check-in prompt system  
- Mood tracking and journal entries  
- Question bank with rotating relationship prompts  
- Mutual responses and “connectedness” meter  
- History log of shared answers for reflection  

These features were selected to address common pain points in relationship communication and to feel light and sustainable for daily use.

3. Visual Design & Aesthetic  
A minimal and modern UI was chosen with calming tones, soft shadows, and rounded elements to evoke a sense of ease and intimacy. The layout guides users naturally through their check-in, keeping distractions low.

4. User Journey Flow  
The user flow is structured for ease:  
- Morning prompt notification  
- Quick daily check-in via mood scale and reflection  
- Evening reflection or bonus prompt  
- Shared insights between partners  

This encourages emotional syncing without overloading the users.

5. Technical Thoughts / Logic Planning  
While no code is required, the pseudocode created outlines how the check-in logic might work. The app logic would involve:  
- Generating a new daily prompt  
- Storing user responses securely  
- Matching responses between partners  
- Allowing for feedback or emojis in reaction  

6. Future Possibilities  
- AI-generated prompt customization  
- Therapist-curated prompt packs  
- Integration with calendars or wellness apps
