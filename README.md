# Tethered: A Conceptual Support App for Couples

**Tethered** is a conceptual mobile app designed to help couples strengthen their relationship through meaningful, daily interactions. Built around psychological research and user needs, Tethered encourages intentional communication, collaborative goal-setting, and personalized conflict support â€” all while respecting privacy and inclusivity.


## Problem Statement

Many couples struggle with:
- Inconsistent communication and reflection habits
- Lack of accessible tools for healthy conflict resolution
- Limited support for diverse relationship structures

Apps like *Paired* attempt to bridge the gap, but they often fall short in:
- Privacy-respecting transparency
- Conflict-specific guidance
- Inclusive design for polyamorous or nontraditional couples


## Solution Overview

**Tethered** supports healthy habits through:
- ðŸ§  **Daily Micro-Reflections**: Quick daily check-ins with prompts
- ðŸ”— **Shared Goals**: Collaboratively set and track relationship goals
- ðŸ’¬ **Conflict Support**: Tools for pausing, reframing, and resolving disagreements
- ðŸ”’ **Privacy Controls**: Personal journaling + controlled sharing
- ðŸŒˆ **Inclusivity First**: Designed to support various relationship models
