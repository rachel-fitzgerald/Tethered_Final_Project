# Tethered_Final_Project

## 📌 Overview
**Tethered** is a conceptual couples-focused app designed to strengthen emotional connection through intentional daily check-ins and shared reflections. This project was developed as part of my final assignment for CIS129, with a focus on designing software that solves a real-world relationship challenge.

## 💡 Problem Statement
In busy modern life, many couples struggle to maintain consistent, meaningful communication. Existing tools are either too casual or not tailored to intentional relationship-building. Tethered seeks to solve that problem with an experience rooted in shared emotional presence.

## 🛠️ Features and Design
- Daily emotion check-ins and thoughtful prompts
- Private, shared reflection space between partners
- Gentle notifications and streak tracking for consistency
- Designed to foster healthy communication, not just messaging
