# Tethered – Pseudocode Overview

This file outlines the core logic for three of Tethered’s key features: Daily Check-In, Conflict Pause Tool, and Shared Goal Tracker.

---

## 1. Daily Check-In

Purpose: Prompt users to reflect briefly on their emotional state and relationship tone each day.

Function DailyCheckIn(user_id):
    Prompt user with reflection questions:
        - How are you feeling today?
        - What’s one thing your partner did you appreciated?
        - What’s something you’re looking forward to?
    Store responses with timestamp

    Ask: Share with partner? (Yes/No)
    If Yes:
        Send shared reflections to partner’s inbox
    Else:
        Save privately in user journal

    End Function

## 2. Conflict Pause Tool
Function ConflictPause(user_id, partner_id):
    Display calming interface with:
        - Breathing timer
        - Reminder: “Take a moment before reacting”

    Prompt each partner:
        - What are you feeling right now?
        - What’s your perspective on the conflict?
        - What do you need to feel heard?

    Save responses in private log
    Suggest re-connection prompt (e.g., “Would you like to review each other’s reflections later?”)

    End Function

## 3. Goal Tracker
Function CreateSharedGoal(user_id, partner_id, goal_text, duration):
    Prompt both users to confirm goal
    If both agree:
        Save goal with start date and end date
        Track progress (e.g., check-ins, tasks, notes)
    Else:
        Cancel goal setup

    Notify each partner of updates (weekly summary, check-ins)

    End Function
